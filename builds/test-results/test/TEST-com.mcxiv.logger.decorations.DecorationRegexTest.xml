Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of
them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of
2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9
million developers.[21]Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
(which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun
Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary
licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community
Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official
reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used
by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.As of
September 2020, the latest version is Java 15, with Java 11, a currently supported
long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last
zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial
use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use
indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that
are still receiving security and other upgrades.
